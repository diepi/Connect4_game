# Connect4_game
My first python project

## Introduction
The code runs connect4 game. 

It allows the game to be played by 2 humans, a human against a computer, or computer against itself. In this game two players take turns dropping objects from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next available space within the column. 

The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizonala, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.
The module should also allow the current game to be saved, and a previously saved game to be loaded and continued.
